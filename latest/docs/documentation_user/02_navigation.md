[Back to Overview](README.md)

## Welcome view
AsTeRICS Grid initially starts with a welcome view giving the choice between:

1. **Use AsTeRICS Grid without registration:** choose this option in order to create a local default user and directly start using AsTeRICS Grid.
1. **Register now:** choose this option in order to sign up for an online user, which makes it possible to synchronize the grids across devices.

See [Terms](01_terms.md#User) for more information about offline/online users.

## Main view
Once taken a decision in the welcome view AsTeRICS Grid subsequently starts in the "main view" which looks like Figure 1 (desktop view on the left, mobile view on the right):

![main view](./img/main_en.jpg)

1. **Inactive online user**: The little cloud symbol indicates an online user (see [Terms](01_terms.md#user)) and the gray user symbol that he is currently inactive, meaning that the user's grids are currently not used.
1. **Inactive offline user**: The gray user symbol without a cloud indicates an inactive offline user (see [Terms](01_terms.md#user))
1. **Open**: sets the user "active" and opens the main view, showing the user's grid(s). Sets all other users inactive, there is always only one active user.
1. **Delete**: deletes the user and all of his grids and configuration. Use with caution, this action cannot be undone. This option is only available for offline users.
1. **Logout**: deletes the user and all of his grids and configuration, but only on the current device. Data in the cloud and on other devices that are logged in with the same user will not be deleted. This option is only available for online users.
1. **Login with other user**: put in username and password of an existing online user in order to add it to the current device. In order to create a new online or offline user, follow one of the links below.
1. **Remember checkbox**: if checked, the newly logged in online user will be saved to the device and listed in the list of users in the current user view. If unchecked the user will only be opened temporarily and no user data will be saved on the device (recommended for logging in on foreign devices).

For information about offline or online users and how to add them see [Users](06_users.md).
