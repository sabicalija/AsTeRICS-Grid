# Internationalization
This chapter is about internationalization (translation of elements) in AsTeRICS Grid which can be done in three ways:

1. [dom-i18n](07_i18n.md#dom-i18n)
1. [i18nService.js](07_i18n.md#i18nservicejs)
1. [Vue.js filter](07_i18n.md#vuejs-filter)

[Back to Overview](README.md)

## dom-i18n
The library [dom-i18n](https://github.com/ruyadorno/dom-i18n) provides an very easy to use possibility for adding translations to an HTML site. Wherever possible it's used within AsTeRICS Grid. The file [aboutView.vue](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/src/vue-components/views/aboutView.vue) shows it's usage within a Vue component:

1. Usage within HTML: `<h2 data-i18n="">About AsTeRICS Grid // Über das AsTeRICS Grid</h2>`
    * property `data-i18n` on an HTML element indicates that the content of this `h2` tag is internationalized
    * content in different languages is placed directly within the HTML element, separated by ` // `
    * first language is English, second German
1. For displaying only the content of the correct language, in the Javascript part of the component this code has to be executed (see [aboutView.vue:88](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/src/vue-components/views/aboutView.vue#L88)):
    ```
    mounted() {
        i18nService.initDomI18n();
    }
    ```
    * the `mounted()` function is called by Vue.js after initialization of the component
    * `i18nService.initDomI18n()` initializes the dom-i18n library for this component, showing only the translations of correct language
    * if it's a dynamic Vue.js component it's maybe necessary to call `i18nService.initDomI18n()` also in the Vue.js `updated()` method which is called after each view update
    
The dom-i18n library is initialized in [i18nService.js](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/src/js/service/i18nService.js). There it would be possible to add additional languages by adding it to the `language` property within the `i18nService.initDomI18n()` method.


## i18nService.js
If a translation is needed in a piece of Javascript code, the method `i18nService.translate(key)` can be used. The `key` property to pass and it's translations are also defined in `i18nService`. It's also possible to pass parameters to the `translate` method which are inserted in `{?}` placeholders in the translated strings.

### Usage example
In order to ask the user a translated question with parameter this code can be used:
```
if (confirm(i18nService.translate('CONFIRM_DELETE_GRID', 'My grid'))) {
    // delete grid
}
```

These could be the defined translations within `i18nService.js`:
```
i18nService.translations['en']['CONFIRM_DELETE_GRID'] = 'Do you really want to delete the grid "{?}"?'
i18nService.translations['de']['CONFIRM_DELETE_GRID'] = 'Möchten Sie das Grid "{?}" wirklich löschen?'
```

The result will be a confirmation dialog containing:
* non-german browser setting: *Do you really want to delete the grid "My grid"?*
* german browser setting: *Möchten Sie das Grid "My grid" wirklich löschen?*

## Vue.js filter
There is also an implemented Vue.js filter for translation which uses the `i18nService.translate()` method. It's implemented in [vuePluginManager.js#initFilters()](https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid/blob/master/src/js/vue/vuePluginManager.js#L39). General usage is a pipe within any double curly braces expression, for instance `{{variableToTranslate | translate}}`. A real use-case could look like this:

```
<li v-for="action in gridElement.actions">
    <span>{{action.modelName | translate}}</span>
</li>
```

This piece of Vue.js code iterates over the array `actions` of the object `gridElement` and generates a `span` with a translated version of the `modelName` of each action as content.
